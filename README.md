# Public release of the ARD Grading Utility

Useful for duty states/ logs / etc - This was custom made for a gaming guild but I decided to release it publicly as I have left them.

## Installation

Clone the repo to an empty folder

```git clone https://github.com/ribcatcher/ard-bot-public```

Move into that folder.

```cd ard-bot-public```

Run npm install

```npm install```

## Setup
See `config.env.example` and `bot_authkey.env.json.example` for details on what you need to set up.
Remember to remove the `.example` from the ends when you're done.

## Running the bot

```node index.js```

Contact @ribcatcher#5378 on discord if you have any problems.
